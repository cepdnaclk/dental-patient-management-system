## Introduction


### About
The Faculty of Science at the University of Peradeniya has developed a dental patient management system for use at the Peradeniya Hospital. However, it has been identified that the current system does not fully meet the requirements of the Dental Clinic. Consequently, the Dental Faculty has entrusted us with the task of developing an improved system.

Our solution, known as "Dental Patient Management," is a web-based application that has been meticulously designed to enhance efficiency and user-friendliness. Its primary aim is to automate and streamline the collection and collaboration of patient data. This application has been developed collaboratively by the E18 Batch and our team, with our specific focus on the dental patient management component.

### Challenges of current System
- Unefficiency In Data Collection
- Difficulty To Get Relevant Data
- Misplacement Risks
- Data Inaccuracy And Errors
- Data Duplication
- Limited Accessibility
- Security And Privacy Concerns
- Time Consuming Documentation
- Patient Experience

### Why Management
- Improved Patient Care
- Efficient Faculty Management
- Security And Data Integrity
- Reduced Errors And Clarity
- Streamlined Communication
- Time And Cost Saving
- User Friendly Interface
- Automation Of Workflow
